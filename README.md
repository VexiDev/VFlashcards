# VFlashcards
A local electron app for learning using flashcards (includes SM2 Algorithm)
> DISCLAIMER:
> This app is probably full of bugs, errors and redundant code. <br>It was a test project for the `Cursor IDE` and OpenAIs `o1 preview` model based on an original version I wrote myself. <br>I may rewrite this myself in the future using modern web frameworks but for now its local only.
